#Report OS Project##Environment and choicesI was working on a MAC OSX System (Maverick)with Atom editor and Clang compiler (Apple LLVM  version 5.1 ) on command line. The built command  line application consists of five header files  a n d o n e c p p f i l e : d a t a _ p r o c e s s i n g . h ,  cpu_scheduler.h, fcfs_scheduling.h, rr_scheduling.h,  srtf_scheduling.h and cpu_scheduler.cpp (that    contains the main logic of the application). I    tried to give an importance to clean and    maintainable code, even if this objectif is not    perfectly reached. Efficiency was not the matter    in this project since using C++ is kind of    efficient, it could be better with C of course.    The STL, the Abstraction and the Oriented Object    Programming style have not been used.##ProgrammingThis project helped me to really understand the cpu scheduling algorithm. It allows me to understand how the cpu works for real. The easiest algorithm was the FCFS one, but the SRTF was the most challenging. The computation of turnaround time and waiting time for some algorithm was not easy too.
